pioneer-thirdparty
==================

This repository contains third-party packages required to build Pioneer. Not
all environments/systems provide all the necessary packages, and some do but
have made modifications that render them unsuitable for use in Pioneer. This
will give you everything you need in a form that is tested and supported by
the Pioneer devs.
